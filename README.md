# tmmt: A Transfer Matrix Method Toolkit in Matlab
## by Gary Scavone, McGill University.

NOTE: This repository is no longer supported, since the functionality of tmmt has now been subsumed into the [acmt](https://github.com/garyscavone/acmt) repository.

This repository contains Matlab scripts that implement the Transfer Matrix Method for acoustic modeling. Instrument definition files are in the [geometries/](geometries) directory. Example usage files are in the [examples/](examples) directory. The [asa2021/](asa2021) directory contains the HTML "slides" from my tutorial lecture at the Acoustical Society of America meeting on 9 June 2021.
